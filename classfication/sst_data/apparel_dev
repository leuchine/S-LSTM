the only thing better than these sunglasses is the customer service i got , after i dropped and broke the lenses on these i called 80 's purple and they actually sent me out a replacement free of charge . i was blown away ||| 1
this light worked for one day . i should have known better because in the past , i bought a tap light , and it worked for only a few days , too . do n't waste your money ||| 0
i 've tried 6 different nursing bras . this one , with the center snap closure , is the easiest to use . it is also the lightest and most comfortable , while providing good support . my only complaint is that after about 50 washes the underwire begins to poke free from the fabric . even when i try to sew it back into place , it breaks loose after a few washes . perhaps if i handwashed the bra instead of using a machine , it would last longer . this bra is less durabe than my other nursing bras ( particularly the leading lady bra , which seems to be indestructible ) , but it is well worth the sacrifice for comfort , lightness , and ease of use . it is by far my favorite ||| 1
i have had my bag for a couple of months . the liner on the inside has already ripped ||| 0
the photo is quite deceiving . this suit is made out of cheap polyester fabric that looks cheap , shiny , and is horrible to the touch . my three year olds hate the uncomfortable stiffness . spend the extra money for a decent fabric that is actually practical for a toddler if they really need a suit ||| 0
i had bought a bra of this model at a discount store , just got lucky . it quickly became my favorite , and i was glad to find it at amazon . ||| 1
lookslike it would be a nice product , but it 's only for very small babies up to 12 pounds and 23 inches . my baby is very long and just does n't fit - wish target/amazon would have been more upfront with the sizing ||| 0
i purchased the non-premium kit ( $ 9.99 ) with a silicone skin case cover and 2 screen protectors ( one for each screen ) , but it is the same case . the problem is that the silicone skin cover is slippery , twice as slippery as the nintendo lite without the cover . we thought that washing them in dove dish soap would wash away the slipperyness , but that did n't work . after handling the cover , your hands have a slippery residue on them . the other issue is that the cover is so thin that it is little more than scratch protection , not impact protection . the screen covers that come with the non-premium kit are ok , i guess , but one of them had 2 defect particles that were raised ( trust me , the screen was clean ) . i purchased 2 kits , and i had one screen protector defect and my wife accidentally broke one of the silicone covers hinge straps with little effort . i do not recommend this product at all ||| 0
good quality jeans at an affordable price . size is just right , quite comfortable ||| 1

i love these shoes and they are so cute and comfortable . the heel is not so tall that you feel like you ca n't walk . customer service and shipping was excellent . best price i could find . do n't hesitate on this purchase . you 'll love them ||| 1
this is a piece of garbage . it 's cute-looking , and *just barely* will fit *just* your ds and maybe a few games and the cleaning cloth , but as far as any kind of long-term travel functionality , look elsewhere . the charger does n't fit in there very well , which i do n't think is an unreasonable demand for a handheld device carrying case . i was able to squeeze both my ds lite and the charger in there for awhile , but recently the zipper broke , and i had to split it apart to get to my stuff , and now it 's useless . if all you want is something to carry just the ds in , this is a decent option . otherwise , forget it ||| 0
it 's really hard to buy scrub pants on-line because everyone is different . cherokee always fits perfectly and good quality . i think they should consider a wider array of sizes in petite . by the time i finished hemming them , i did n't have that cute slit at the bottoms . they wash well and wear well ||| 1
i initially bought these shoes for my mom for a christmas gift , but she said they were too high for her . well i fixed that , i kept them for myself . : ) i love them and they are really hot ! thnx ja ||| 1
i have a 33-34 waste . i bought the medium size because it is advertised to be fit for 32-34 waste . the thing is too tight ! it almost blocks circulation to my legs . plus , the fabric is not entirely pleasant to the touch . i was mostly disappointed with this product . you can find a much better value at this price ||| 0
the product was received on 6/18 . when i tried it on i found it to be too large , utilizing the return form included with the order i completed it and returned the item via ups on 6/20 . i 'm still not sure about the return policy ! when i had n't heard from the uniform company after about 2 weeks i called them . i was informed that they did in fact receive my return but the size that i needed , large , was not in stock and it would be 4 to 5 days before it could be shipped . i 'm still waiting ! when i get the product i can properly review it ||| 0
i missed my late 80s over the knee suede boots , which is why i got these . they are great ! the only thing that could be much improved are the soles and heel . they are very thing . i 'd wear them out in a day . i had to have them resoled . but the ammazon price was so good it was still a steal . ||| 1
i ordered this item and a pair of mocha nubuck as well . i 've been wearing birks and various varieties of them for years . i 'm always very satisfied with the fit , delivery time , and the customer service that i receive from midwest sports . i wear my clogs in all sorts of weather except when there is fresh snow , but as soon the walkways and streets are clear , i 'm back in them with thicker socks of course . they can be a little stiff at times , but once you break them in after a couple weeks of constant wearing , you will love them like no other ||| 1

this is a nice shirt , not as warm as we had hoped though . the lining is quite thin . it washes fairly well , loses a bit of its shape but not a lot . a great shirt for the fall . its roomy comfortable ||| 1

it 's only been the last 7 years or so that i 've enjoyed wearing a robe around the house , i admit i used to be walking around in my underwear when i woke up in the morning ! all of my previous robes were typically off the clearance racks , and mostly some kind of inexpensive terrycloth . i bought this becuase my last robe is falling apart . i have to say that although i hesitated to spend 100 bucks on a robe , when it got here and i wore it for a couple days , i really like it . i bought the large black robe ; i 'm 6ft , about 200lbs , a little heavy around the middle , and the robe fits pretty well . the arms are baggy and the sleeves are long enough to touch the back of my hand just after the wrist . the length extends to just about the bottom of my calf muscle in my legs . it `` flows '' nice too , when i walk , not like the heavier terrycloth robe . and the silk lining makes me feel `` rich '' ! overall , i like it ||| 1
i ordered the black one . according to the photo provided , it was supposed to be black with white seams , but when i received it , it was all black . once i put it on it fitted perfectly . but it is simply too difficult to put on even though it is the right size . ||| 0
i totally did n't have a problem with the seller or anything , great shipping ! um , but , the book kinda rots . if you know how to tie a tie already , then it might be fine , but i do n't . the pictures did n't really help , and the wording was n't concise . one sentence could be interpreted like nine ways ! ! i practically destroyed one tie , definitely practice with a tie you do n't care about or one that doesnt need to be dry-cleaned , cuz they get pretty rumpled . ||| 0
unfortunately , the pockets are small , the fabric is poor quality , the seams already have started to split after wearing it twice . overall poor quality . i would not recommend these scrubs . i personally will never buy from this company again . on a more positive note , they did get the right size and shipped promptly ||| 0
this hoodie is very poorly made . i bought a blue version and i had to return it after washing it in cold water on gentle . it faded substantially , changed shape , and the threading came loose . not recommended ! ! ||| 0
this is a top quality item . i is an 80 % /20 % cotton/poly mix-double stitched seams ... very well made . i bought a 2x for my son who ususally wears a 3x , and after putting it through the washer and dryer twice , it 's just as perfect as the day it was delivered . ||| 1
for the money i spent on this bra it should be a better bra all around . it gives a classic `` torpedo '' shape to the breasts , does not offer any lift , and is pretty much unwearable . ||| 0
i have ordered this tux for my 18 months old son for my sister 's wedding . it looked amazing ! ! ! the suit arrived timely and i could n't believe how perfect they have prepared the whole package . all the details were well thought and the tux looked perfect with satin buttons , matching waist band and stripes on the side of the pants . even the shirt is so well tailored . my son was very comfortable in the suit during the whole night and accepted more applouds than the groom ! i sincerely recommend this product ||| 1
these are the best slippers i have ever owned ! ! ! they cradle your feet in super soft memory foam . when i get home from work everyday , i slide my feet into them and am instantly relaxed . i love these slippers ! ! ! the best ever ... after much wear , i will buy another pair ! ||| 1
i had been on the look out for a mary jane pump that i could wear to work with pants and skirts . i finally found this shoe online and decided to give it a try . usually steve madden 's run big on me , so i got a size smaller , and surprisingly , it was actually too small . a half size up did the trick , however . i love that it comes in patent leather because it really adds a kick to your feet . they 're also very comfortable for a high-heeled shoe . my only complaint is that the show is actually very deep on the top , and there 's quite a bit of toe cleavage . i guess this is n't necessarily a bad thing , it just did n't look like that at all in the picture . also , the strap that goes across the top of the foot is very low , and if you have wide feet , it could make your feet look even wider ( or fatter ) . despite those two small flaws , i really like this shoe and find that i can wear it with almost anything ( they look especially cute with skirts ) ||| 1
i was unable to return the item because of restrictions imposed by their return policy i made a mistake by buying i ||| 0
i got these socks as a gift at my baby shower . i 've looked everywhere trying to find them so i could buy more . these socks stay on my little boy 's feet and are made very well ||| 1
must have shoe for bunion and hammertoe sufferers . i also have very hot sweaty feet and these are an excellent choice if you share these problems . very large toe box and excellent webbing for ventilation . very good looking comfortable shoes . only qualification is that if you stand on your feet all day or do a lot of walking you may want to pick a shoe with more support -- these are very lightweight shoes but lack the support a heavier athletic shoe would offer -- but those type of shoes are usually harder on bunions and my feet get extremely hot in them ||| 1
i bought this for my boyfriend . it is soft and comfy . it is definitely comfy for me to snuggle with . and as a bonus he likes it too . my only complaint is that the sleeves are little too long . but overall we are very happy with the purchase ||| 1
incredible boot ! comfort , style and warmth have proved their way with this boot . i get positive comments each time i wear them ! the tread is perfect for walking in snow pack too . you do n't slide a bit . i 'll enjoy these for years ||| 1
i love the color and the flexibility of the material . it does n't slip out of your hand and the cover gives full protection ||| 0
maybe , just maybe , someone will buy one of these stick up bulbs and maybe , just maybe , the bulb will last more than about 10 minutes of total use before it burns out . i thought to myself `` buy another one because maybe this one was defective . '' i bought three more ... ..every time the tiny bulb burned out in minutes of use . it 's a great idea ... .but a worthless piece of junk . the spare bulb ? useless as well . do n't waste a dollar on this junk . if i could have found the receipts i would have gotten my money back . ||| 0
i love this bra ! it is very comfortable and like the other reviewer said , adds a whole cup size ! cheaper than victoria 's secret and well made ||| 1

this is ideal for wearing layers of clothing or if you 're dressed in a short sleeve over this one . however , i personally prefer the long sleeved version by the same company . ||| 1

this bra is one of the most uncomfortable bra 's i 've tried . it 's seems to be made cheaply and digs into my skin . i would not recommend it ||| 0

i bought this dress in black . good news -- - it does flatter your postpartum shape . bad news -- - the pockets for the nursing pads do n't go where they should , causing leakage . worse , the color black showed milk stains after i leaked . definitely not worth the price . how important is your figure when you 're sleeping anyway ||| 0
this belt is seriously great . i ordered it and it arrived 3 days later , exactly as the seller described . i 'm not sure what the previous review was all about , but my belt is great . i love how i can use interchangeable buckles with it ||| 1
the scarf arrived with several holes in it . my daughter was very dissappointed , crying and wondering why santa sent this to her . we ordered well in advance before christmas but the set arrived too late . we were never notified that there would be a delay in shipping . a few days before christmas it arrived ! it was too late to do anything . amazon should improve the quality control of vendors before it allows them to list on their site . ||| 0
this brown leather wallet does not have a highly glossy finish as shown in the image ; leather is well-stitched but thin . old-fashioned style with no credit card slots . snaps and zipper handle add bulk to profile ; not a front pocket wallet for sure . purchased two as gifts for nephews , will probably get one for myself . ||| 1
so far i have been very satisfied with this bag . for the price i really ca n't complain . it has enough different sections , places for pens , a divider , pouches in front and other nice touches that makes it a pleasure to use . i 'm curious about the durability ; how the leather will hold up and if the zippers will last . i use it to hold 2 1 '' notebooks , a textbook , a portfolio , a book , a calculator and my pda . this is about maximum capacity . i should note that the notebooks and portfolio just do fit inside the sections . the handle ontop is cozy , the over the shoulder strap should be wider . overall , i am happy with the purchase , and hope that it lasts ||| 1
i gave these slippers to my mother for christmas and they do not hold up well . the first pair came apart in the wash and the second pair has n't been washed yet , but they 're already coming apart also . not a good buy . ||| 0
i just received two of these bra-less nursing nightgowns ( sm ) , a robe ( sm/m ) , and the two piece tank pj set ( sm ) . i 'm almost nine months pregnant and have gained 50ish pounds and despite the other review about not fitting during pregnancy , it ( and the other items ) fits and stretches well while holding its shape . i will wear this now and indefinitely after the baby comes : it 's apparent that it will fit me well after baby too . the quality of the fabric is substantial enough to hold large ( and engorging ) breasts without the need for a bra . it is strong but breathable , and not flimsy so it slightly smoothes out quirks of the pregnant body . the length is a little longer than most - it slightly covers my knees - which is what i wanted so slit is nice to have for normal strides walking , easing out of bed , hiking up to use the washroom , etc . without tearing the seams . as the description and the other review indicates , the cups can slide down for pumping or nursing . i 'm very happy with the colors , design , and construction of all items . due to the volume of my order ( directly from the [ ... ] site , i received a high quality free minky dot chenille blanket that came rolled and ribboned in a nice tulle bag . i would definitely get this for other expectant or new moms ||| 1
the pj bottoms were soft and of good quality material . however , i ordered the extra large , and they were very small for that size . it seemed as though the xl was more a med/large . i would also think that `` lounge pants '' or `` pj bottoms '' would be a bit bigger as you would n't want these types of pants too tight . they were a gift , so i just hope they do n't shrink after washing ! ||| 1
looks nothing like the image shown . 3 inches shy of even hitting the knee , let alone over it ( and she is n't tall 5'5 '' ) . keep looking ... . ||| 0

it 's a little on the thin side for snowy or freezing weather , but great in keeping the chill off when you 're out and about , or at the game . the blue is actually more of a royal blue than navy blue , but the lettering is well stitched and is the same quality used on mlb baseball caps ( also has the mlb logo on back ) . it folds up easily and can be tucked into a jacket pocket with room to spare . the price is great and makes a great gift ||| 1
i bought two of these , hoping to use them as sashes in a bridal event , and quickly returned them . since it took over two weeks for delivery , i am uncertain as to the efficiency of the return/refund . the sashes are not the quality that i thought was represented by the term `` charmeuse '' , and are thin and gauzy . they came in a large padded envelope with a total wt of under 4oz , much of that must have been the packaging . a quick refund will restore some trust in this vendor and the transaction ||| 0
i am vey unhappy with the sales professional in nautica outlet stores . i had a very bad experience at nautica store outlet stores . the customer service representatives are very rude and unprofessional . they basically said they do n't really care if they lose one customer , other customers will still buy . ( if that is the case , why are prices slashed by 50 % ... it is because people do not want to pay the full price ... ) i do not think i will ever buy from nautica . a few uncaring sales represtatives give a very bad name to the whole company ||| 0
they looks nice , and fit really well , however , not so soft like some other clarks/indigo . ||| 1
while i was a little wary of ordering a jacket for $ 20 online , i went ahead and ordered this one . it seemed like it was made of durable material , and looked snazzy . when it came in the mail today , it was stuffed in a first class envelope with another t-shirt [ which i really like ! ] . i was anxious to see what it was like . this jacket is /literally/ made of the material used for fedex envelopes . sounds cool , huh ? the jacket is extremely thin , and feels like you 're wearing a paper bag . while i appreciate the prompt service of the people at andrew christian , they will probably see my jacket returned within the next couple of weeks ||| 0

i had never ordered from this company before . i have now ordered quite a few things from them . for the price , everything has been very attractive . some of the sizes run a bit small . this dress is very sweet , the paprika color is an orange , but i ordered 3 of these in different colors . nice to wear around the house during the summer . ( i also ordered a nice dress in eggplant , but it is really brown , alright with me , a nice dress . ) customer service was very good to me , and i even received a coupon for 3 free magazine subscriptions , as i had ordered over a certain amount from newport news . i am happy with the price vs. quality of all of their things . shipping was very speedy . for these prices you do not get the quality of neiman 's , sak 's , or bloomie 's - but you get many more nice , simple , summer dresses , of a decent quality . i think that newport news offers good value , and service for the money ||| 1
i bought two of these bags so far . both have failed at the plastic fastener , one arm just snapped in no time . the bag itself is ok , but the plastic parts on the belt are really cheap ... i wont buy a third one . ||| 0
i am very happy with the swimsuit . delivery was as stated . fits wonderfully . the only problem was once i was wearing it , a little of the edge of one of the cups was showing , but i tucked it in whenever it was noticeable . i was very happy that the suit fit nicely because i was a little worried of having to return for a different size and paying shipping . the size i ordered was the size i normally wear and as i said , it fit great ||| 1
the collar stays are great ! they came in a convenient little container , and now i 'm not searching all over the laundry room floor for the collar stays that fell out of my husband 's dress shirts . the different lengths were helpful because he has different style shirts , and the collar stays came very quickly ||| 1
great grip , cool rugged look , comfortable enough for regular winter use as well . was about $ 80 when i got it though . might not be the best option around for $ 130 ||| 1

i absolutely agree with brett a. warner these replacements feel horrible . they do n't have the instant great feeling you got when you put the 991 's on . i bought them at a local store which did not take returns . so they just sit in the closet . if you do purchase these make sureyou can return them because you will . i wear a 11 1/2 ||| 0

i got two problems with this here lingeree : 1 . that model at the top of the page is sparkin hot , how come it never looks the same on my girlfriend ? eh ? false advertizing if ya ask me . their shold be a law that all lingeree models hafta weigh 250 and have a bit of hair on their legs like my woman does . or a warnin label `` objects inside this lingeree are uglier than they appear . '' 2 . i paid $ 14.95 and there aint enough there to blow yer nose on . my suggestion : go for the crotchless or the bustless or the fishnet , but all three is just not enough lingeree and too much girlfriend.. ||| 0

was disappointed with the color of the shoe , because there is a difference between the left and right shoe . at first i thought the wrong models were packed in the box . but no , it 's the shade of the leather that is different , left shoe is darker than the right shoe . being in singapore , it will be expensive for me to ship back for replacement . ( i had the shoe delivered to my brother-in-law in l.a. , who brought it back to singapore for me ||| 0

i purchased the crocs butter thinking it would be something special just for crocs shoes . as soon as i opened the package , i noticed the crocs butter is just like any other shoe buffer/cleaner with the black sponge . i already own two shoe buffers , one of which i received free with purchase from a local shoe store . needless to say , i returned the crocs butter , since it 's not worth $ 4.95 , plus $ 10 shipping , which i was not refunded . what a crock ||| 0
although the dress may seem to fit the ideal dress from the movie , how to lose a guy in 10 days , the cut of the dress leaves extra fabric right under the area of the bust . this made me look awkward and did not fit well . do n't waste your money on the shipping that you will have to pay for when you return it as i did . ||| 0
this workout is short but you will feel `` worked out '' when done . tina cues well and the workout flows very smoothly . no awkward transitions . the ball is used for both total body toning and 4 limb cardio . your core and abs get a great workout too with both traditional and functional moves . i enjoyed the change of using the ball instead of dumbells . definitely `` shocked '' the muscles ||| 1
material was not overly thick and designs were great ! look good on my daughter ||| 1
comfy , tough , lightweight , wrinkly ( like me ) . surprisingly durable considering how thin the fabric is . good stitching . velcro® back pockets will save your wallet ! does n't offer lots of stupid exterior loops and gear-freak cargo pockets . not for the tidy country-club set who need creases on everything , but just perfect for active soccer dads or when the family hound insists on playing fetch with muddy logs and the like ||| 1
they were slightly small and a tad too stiff . but very cut ||| 1
at first i was bugged by how sticky this was , but boy did it work ! they gave me 1/2 ounce tube in the hospital ( and charged me $ 9 for it , but that 's another story ! ) it moisturizes and protects your nipples from chafing while nursing , and does n't bother baby a bit . take my advice , bring your own tube to the hospital to avoid being over-charged ! ||| 1
these are nice sweatshirts . good quality and the prices is half what you might pay for a champion brand . it is oversized so order your normal size and do n't count on much shrinkage ||| 1
the new balance men 's m587 running shoe has been an excellent running shoe . it has a built in rollbar that prevent shin-splints and the shoes are extremely comfortable to run-in . i have been buying this shoe for over four years and two deployments to iraq . i recommend this shoe to any runner that runs 4-5 times a week . ||| 1
i have run in a pair of 991s for the last 5 years . i was disappointed to hear that the 991 was replaced by the 992 . i purchased a pair of 992 hoping for similar comfort and fit . the 992s are nice to look at , but the similarities stop there . the fit is horrible even after going down from a d to a b width . the cushioning i 've come to love in the 991 is simiply not there in the 992 . i had a new balance representative tell me point blank that he would n't recommend the 992 for running at all . what is that old adage ? if it 's not broke do n't fix it . did new balance even test this shoe before implementing it ? 991 lovers beware , this shoe is not for you . i guess the quest begins for a new running shoe ||| 0
we ordered this product , and paid for expedited shipping . 8 days later , it had not arrived . their explanation was that it was 2 day shipping from the day of shipping , but it still took 3 days to get around to shipping . the backpack missed the giftee , and it had to be shipped again to catch up to her ||| 1
i am very happy with the above purchase.i am very impressed with the arrival and condition of the item . i like it because it fits well and when you wear it , you feel quite cool . will shop agai ||| 1
who has n't wanted a pair of these since they were a little girl ? so glamorous , girly , and sexy . i was surprised how comfortable they are on the foot . they really do feel like slippers , just with the heel as a bonus . i normally wear a 6w or a 6 ½ , so these are a little snug , but not too bad . so glad i bought them- two pairs red black . pink will be next.. ||| 1
these go on real easy , and come off real easy . they feel like a regular cotton sock except that they wick sweat away . i 'm ordering more ||| 1
minimzer is correct , i bought this bra in a 38ddd and it made me look more like a d or dd . it lifted and minim1zed my breasts . my only complaint is that the cup was rounded but the lining made a barely noticeable point . if you want your breasts to appear one or two sizes smaller then this is the bra for you . ||| 1
this cologne is the perfect balance of wood and sweetness . it is not overpowering , and it is very masculine . i bought it for my boyfriend , and found that on him it 's even more potent ! it 's aa great fragranc ||| 1

these fit a tiny bit loose but the comfort level is great . shoes at amazon.com are one of my favorite on-line purchases , great prices ||| 1
this is a great fit for a silk shirt . i thought it would not be a close fit being silk , but i was wrong . this item fits snug and looks great on . both alone and layered . i would recommend this shirt to people that like the look of a tight tank . ||| 1
the fabric in these slacks allow you to sit for hours and then stand knowing your slacks look neat and freshly pressed . they wash beautifully and require little or no ironing . my husband wishes all of his slacks wore this well . the hidden elastic makes the slacks just as comfortable when you are sitting down or bending down as they are when you are standing . frankly i wish i could find slacks for women that were this well made especially at the price hagaar offers . haagar has done a terrific job again ||| 1
i ordered 3 products from dance now ... none of them fit being at least one size too small . when i contacted dance now regarding this issue they told me that these shoes are sized for women . men need 2 sizes larger in their street shoe size . i found no reference to that detail on the amazon website . dance now representative told me it is referenced on their own website . but amazon does not make that fact known . so now i have 2 orders i have to pay shipping to dance now as well as their exhchange cost . i am a bit unhappy over this ||| 1

i received an email from txshirts stated that i should direct all inquiries to csr @ txshirts.com . i did this on two occasions and received no reply . customer service finally contacted me only to ask why i had left negative feedback on amazon . they stated they never received any email from me . their gym shorts were not as described . the description said `` covered elastic waistband '' . instead , i received an `` uncovered '' elastic waistband that digs into my skin and leaves indentations on my skin . their response ? i should pay for return shipping in order to get my money back . but who should pay for return shipping when an item is falsely advertised ? ? ||| 0

i ordered these robes ( in white and ivory ) as christmas gifts for my mother and father-in-law . they arrived quickly and beautifully packaged . last week , i was told that they loved their thick and luxurious robes - they feel as if they are at a spa . i was concerned about the one size fits all sizing , but i was told that she loved the extra coverage ( she 's probably a size 14-16 ) and this is one of the few robes that goes around his expanding waistline ( i buy him xl sweaters ) . i will order one for myself as soon as i am in the market for a robe . ||| 1

i have been looking for a pair of docs for a while . i know they are a new globalized company , and i am not necessarily against that . i am disappointed that you ca n't get a better range of colors . i 've had a few blue pairs and a lovely green . but colors are not really available now except on high tops emblazoned with the brand name . an abomination for sure ! these shoes are very comfortable and apparently well-made . my single quibble with the black pair i got here on amazon has to do with the flimsiness of the tongue . i like a nice strong tongue . ( and who does n't ? ) whatever they saved on material here may have been a mistake . on the other hand , maybe the sole will wear out first ( or it will be a dead heat ) . never thought i 'd buy shoes online , but amazon and the doctor made it happen . ||| 1
bra was more padded than i thought when ordering . descriptions of products are not adequate . thanks , though ... love shopping on amazo ||| 1
i bought these shoes and wore them to my first fitting . by the end of my fitting , my feet were throbbing , red , and pinched . literally , my pinky toe was purple . i bought my true size , but i still do n't think these shoes would 've been wearable even with a size larger . they must just be really narrow ||| 0
i couldnt resist these shoes for the price ... i 've had good experience with bandolino branded shoes . i have two other pairs that are stylish and very comfortable . sure enough , this pair of boots are very comfortable too ! the color is a great burnished bronze , that is a great neutral color to wear ( plus metallics are in fashion again ) . the zip-up is easy , and the calf is roomy . i 'm very happy with them , and would recommend them to anyone who does n't want to spend 100 's of dollars , but wants to get the look and comfort of expensive shoes ||| 1
it is a comfortable little t-shirt dress for 9 bucks . be careful because the sizes run small . if you get it , buy a size larger than you normally would ||| 0
genuine leather with fur lining are about the warmest things you can possibly wear ! an excellent choice for extremely cold winter weather , well worth the money spent . ||| 1

i am technically a 32jj ( per some lingerie store lady ) , but have worn 34 dd and ddd since high school ( i 'm 27 now ) and have been on the hunt for a good nursing bra ( 33 weeks pregnant today ) . i tried the `` medela seamless underwire full fit nursing bra '' in a 34g and 34h . this one is the most supportive , but is an underwire ( which after 8 hours , i ca n't wait to take off - and i 've always been a committed underwire wearer ) and the h cup fits , but i 'm nervous about if it will fit once my milk really comes in . i also tried the `` fancee free foam support soft cup nursing bra , '' which i also got in a 34g and 34h is not the most supportive , but is comfortable ( i wear this one to bed , around the house , etc. ) . so , regarding the goddess bra - i just got a 34g and yes , the cups are a little big , which i 'm so thankful for because that will certainly allow for some growth and they are n't so big that my breasts look silly through shirts . not to mention , the cup part that is looser is mostly around the nipple ( i 've been instructed to begin wearing a nipple shield , so it allows for room for that so-not-inconspicuous item to be ) . my favorite part is the back portion , which is a stretchy cotton and does not dig into my ribs by the end of the day like the others . it is also pretty supportive , maybe a 9 out of 10 in supportiveness compared to the medela - but steps above the fancee free . i will likely buy one more g and an h in this style - and call it a day on buying nursing bras because i finally found what i 'm looking for . i 'd recommend buying one that is a cup size below what you normally wear if you 're looking to wear it right now and you may have to wear a size up after milk comes in . this bra really got me excited - enough that after 4 years of ordering from amazon , this is the first review i was ever compelled to write . hope you find the same success with this bra , too . good luck ||| 1
at first i thought i would n't like this bra because it has to be pulled over you head to put it on . however , this is the most comfortable bra i bought , and i bought a lot of different kinds . this is perfect for engorgement and just plain daily comfort ||| 1
i do n't own this gear bag , and i 'm not going to buy it even though it looks interesting . would this be a suitable carry-on bag , or would i have to check it ? i do n't know . the dimensions are not given anywhere . i want to know more about the products i order ||| 0

this was at 1oth birthday gift for my son . we are california transplants living in texas , and no one here , at the time , had any idea that kobe had even changed his number from 8 to 24 . it was a nightmare ( and a lot of driving around ) trying to find kb 's 24 . i found it on your site and the product was just what i expected , no surprises . my son loves it ! ||| 1
it 's true that you get what you pay for . the good thing i can say about this product is that the price is right . but the quality was low and the fit was poor . however , if you are strapped for money then they are certainly wearable . but get a half size smaller than you usually would get ||| 0

these slippers are very comfy and fit true to size . however , the fabric part between the toes is not anchored to the solid part of the slipper . it 's sewn to the terry lining covering this solid part and when i walk , the slippers fall off my feet . i will not purchase these slippers again . ||| 0
i quesss for the price you cant beat it , but i think it should have said patch leather , or leather pieces , also the size runs larger , than regular coats , xl was really more like an xxl.but like i said for the price you cant beat it , i really should have invested more and got a better coat . thank you dlan ||| 0

it 's october 8th , 2006 . the detroit tigers have just defeated the new york yankees to advance to the american league championship series . people counted the tigers out . everyone thought the yankees would walk into comerica ballpark and put a serious damper on the success the tigers have produced all season long . nope . did n't happen . the tigers won 95 games this year . no one thought the tigers advancing this far was possible , but when you have excellent stars such as magglio ordonez , curtis granderson , ivan rodriguez , marcus thames , craig monroe and kenny rogers , you ca n't lose . the manager jim leyland also played a major part in helping to reshape the tigers as a team , and give them much-needed direction . he was probably the main reason they won so many games . the tigers are now a team everyone can love- not just detroit fans . tv stations are now playing tigers games again and reminding people that yes , the tigers are still around . the fact that the tigers have n't been mentioned for the last 10 years shows that the fans may have forgotten all about the team , but beating the yankees last night was solid proof the team is back , and threatening . proof that the tigers can hang with the big boys . the celebration after the final out in game 4 was wonderful . everyone on the team lifted jim leyland on their shoulders and proudly walked around the field , while the fans celebrated and cheered indicating they still remember those successful championship years a long time ago , and obviously still support their home team . it got extremely crazy when the team decided to spray champagne at the audience , and they enjoyed it ! even a cop wanted to be sprayed . the celebration supposedly lasted an hour . this vintage crest t-shirt should proudly be worn by you . i want you to take a trip to new york city wearing this shirt and walk down the street so everyone can see how much of a proud , loyal detroit tigers fan you are . the days of watching them lose game after game are finally over . long live the tigers . make sure you buy this shirt to celebrate the wonderful run the tigers had in the season of 2006 . you need to wear orange if you live in the detroit area . ||| 1
nice to put on after a long day of work or after being outside shoveling the snow .do reccomend ||| 1
i have been a 34 size for my entire life and this bra fits terrible ... the fabric is stiff and so uncomfortable..i could not wait to take it off . champion should stick to making sports bra ... do not buy this bra or you will suffer . plus , it looks much thinner in the picture..it is really thick ... it feels like a maternity bra . ugh ||| 0
these socks do not fit the sizes specified . the elastic is so tight that you can hardly get them on your feet . i gave them to my 12 yr. old son and they were too tight on him also , i threw them out . this is the first and last time i will buy those socks . the reebok sneakers are great though ||| 0
i 'm 19 years old and saw these at bloomingdales the other day and decided to buy them . i took them home , tried them on , and i was absolutely amazed . they are a bit of a low rise , but that only adds to the flattery . and i like my underwear that way . there are a bunch of different sizes you can button the sling to , and once you find the perfect fit , you can hardly even feel that it 's there . i give it a perfect score , and i am definatley going to buy more of these ||| 1
i like the look of the shoes and the shiny parts are easy to clean , although the cloth parts are difficult to keep clean . i have a high arch and they seem to support well so i would say over all they were a good choice ||| 1

the main thing here is that the bag shipped with out the strap . i bought it for my wife to carry `` all that stuff '' to work . with out the strap it does not work . i requested another one , got it , no strap . on the plus side is the bag looked and felt as pictured and the packing was , if any thing , over done . gre ||| 0
we bought this for our 13 month old for christmas and she loves it . it is extremely soft . her favorite part is the cell phone that rings . the compact also squeaks . i love that it is all soft so that she can not hurt herself with it . this is a perfect gift for a 1-year-old girl ||| 1
i was looking for the lightest , slimmest possible wallet , and the dopp getaway is just about perfect . for the first couple of weeks i kept sticking my hand in my pocket to make sure it was still there - it 's that unobtrusive . it 's made out of soft , thin leather ( so thin , actually , that the embossed lettering on my credit cards shows through the surface ) . that might affect the durability , but it certainly keeps the overall bulk of the wallet down . the illustration shows a large embossed crest , but mine arrived with only discreet lettering saying `` dopp '' at the bottom - a significant improvement , in my mind . the wallet has pockets for 3 credit cards and a little pouch , open on the top and one side , to hold your cash . there 's also one additional pocket that 's ideal for other documents you just have to carry . the only slight negative for me was the caramel-colored vinyl lining of the cash pocket . i do n't know why they used such a low-class material there . it 's invisible from the outside , and not really offensive , but if i could change one thing , that would be it . i debated knocking off a star for it , but the overall function and appearance of the wallet is so excellent that i thought it deserved the full five stars . overall , if you 're disciplined about what you carry , you 'll love the small size and low bulk of this wallet . ||| 1
for me , they are very difficult to put on . i have to use a long shoe horn . they are n't tight , in fact they are so wonderfully comfortable and warm . they look great if you like the ugg look . i 'm hoping when they loosen up , they will be easier to put on . the top scrunches down when i put my foot in that is why it is so hard to get them on . it could be me though ! otherwise , i love everything else about them . van c ||| 1
i got the flip flops for my granddaughter for christmas she wore her cheap ones out from wal-mart and her mother told her white is summer only and no one could find white ones right now i told her i bet her i could and so i did and she loves them and so did all her friends at school . we know it is winter but so far in indiana it is not bad so you can wear flip flops and tanks for now . thank you for the great gift . ||| 1
i am a 44dd i am having the hardest time finding a good bra ... i ordered this one and i am a little dissapointed . the underwires in the front poke out and make it look like i have these bones sticking straight out of my chest . everthing else is ok ... no complaints other than the underwire not laying flush with my chest bone ||| 0
i buy these wherever i can find them . it 's a bit of a tribute to my aunt , for her middle name , but wish i could find them more frequently . ||| 1
great slippers , very comfortable . i love the fact that the front is open in case i just got a pedicure . and the black ones are perfect because they do n't show dirt like the white ones ||| 1

poor quality and flared like a maternity top.if you order from lands end thru amazon and the item goes on price break , several of the items i have ordered have gone on a price break.lands end will not ajust the price , you will need to send the item back pay for more shipping and they will re ship , they do n't charge for shpping and they act like they are doing you a favor , the customer service will even tell you that you should have ordered from the direct.the customer service will do little for you since you ordered it from amazon and they will tell you until they and you are blue in the face , that they can not help you because it was ordered from amazon.good luck ||| 0

the leather was good quality . the wallet was well constructed . i gave it as a gift and it turned out better than i it looked on the internet . grade a product ||| 1
beware , the size is not true size fit my small turn out to be something that fits like a large from some other brands . this is not a small , it 's loose fitting and it 's a straight line cut . it 's really bad.it 's so disappointing . everything doesnt holds in places , it doesnt look like the photo at all . the materials is nice but the fittting is beyond horrid . dont buy this dress unless you are really curvy , and if you are a medium , you need a small for this dress , and it will still fit loosly on you . that 's how big of a dress this is . i 'm returning it ||| 0
whoever said the 80 's are making a comeback was n't lying ! i love american apparel clothing especially this deep v-neck shirt . just know that it really is deep ! i 'm only in my twenties but i almost feel like an older man when i wear this shirt ; cut lower than other v-necks your chest hair is bound to hang out ! if your cool with that then go buy the shirt cause it ca n't get any more comfortable than it already is ! honestly , i probably wo n't wear it anywhere other than the gym and home , but i still love it ||| 1
i bought this as a birthday gift for my husband , and while i was n't expecting the best quality in the world ( because of the price ) , i was still a little disappointed . the company did a wonderful job of packaging/shipping the product-even the buttons were individually protected . i paid for expedited shipping , but they still cut the deadline close , so i was nervous about it arriving in time . the lining on the inside is thick and bulky so it is n't as streamlined as the pic implies , and tends to make the leather bulge a bit in places . ( it was lumpy-looking even in the box . ) removing the zip-out lining does n't change this -- there 's significant padding in the shoulders . it 's also a shinier leather than expected . sizing chart seems a bit inaccurate -- i ordered a size larger than he normally wears in coats ( which is a size larger than his regular clothing ) , but it was still too snug in places , lining or not . overall , though , i 'd say i got what i paid for , if you do n't count the unusually high shipping charges . ( even standard shipping and handling charges were unusually high compared to other companies . ||| 0

i bought these to replace an identical pair that i 've been wearing for ten years . i got the old ones in london , and they were made in england . this new pair was made in china . they have changed ... some for the good and some for the bad . there is now more toe room , which i like . however , both heel pads were ill fitted and loose . i had to trim them and stick them back in with super glue . i 'm starting to really break them in now and i think i 'll love them for years to come . they provide good ankle support and keep my feet warm . buyer beware that these boots come very very stiff , and will take time to break in . when i first get them , i just wear them around the house occasionally until i can actually wear them out for a bit . if you try to wear them too long when you first get them , they will most definitely wear blisters on your feet . break them in slowly and you 'll have a wonderfully comfortable pair of boots to last a long time . ||| 1

my son runs true to size on most clothing including childrens place but the pjs run very small and when i held them up to each other the different patterns were sized different . at 5 months he is still wearing 3-6 mo in most pjs but already grown our of childrens place 6-9 mo pjs . i bought several pairs and some of them he never could wear . buy a different brand unless you can go to the store and actually try them on ||| 0
this was a poorly made product . even when left still on a table , north took about 2 min to locate - something unusable for most people who are out on the run and need to know where north is , now . also it advertises a thermometer on the packaging , but there was n't one i could find . i ended up returning this for a full refund ||| 0
i bought this tank in red the color of the fabric is wonderfully vibrant . the quality of the fabric is so nice that i wore the top to dinner with a printed skirt received several compliments on the outfit . caution ! this style runs about 1 size small . athletica offers excellent , personalized customer service and every one of the 10 tank tops i ordered were of a quality for which some brands cost as much as $ 38 . ||| 1
i purchased six of these chairs in august for myself and my friends before the start of the college football season for tailgaiting . they were all made by this manufacturer ( north pole ) and had different nfl logos on them ( i only bought one through amazon , the others were bought through different companies due to availability issues ) . at the first game of the season , my chair ( steelers ) broke . at the second game of the season , two more chairs ( bengals and broncos ) broke . they were not misused and no weight limits were exceeded . they all broke in the same exact place ; the plastic pieces at the base of the legs all cracked . therefore , 3 out of 6 broke within probably less than 3-5 hours . needless to say , at $ 25- $ 30 each i would recommend prospective buyers to spend their money elsewhere ||| 0
this bag was not what i expected . the leather was cheap and it was n't really big enough to fit much . i would not recommend this bag if you want it to hold a lot of items/paper . ||| 0
extremely disappointed in this bag . it was n't even heavily loaded , just some folders with papers , keys , phone , make up , wallet . on the very first use the strap broke before i even got home . also , the stitching is coming loose . also the strap is not leather . a big waste of money . ||| 0
i purchased the scarlett version of this bag more than two years ago , and it 's still in perfect condition ! the color does n't fade when you wash it , and it 's the most durable bag i 've ever owned . i will not , refuse to , absolutely can not make me carry a purse , but i carry this bag everyday . the very front zipper pocket is great for change , the small zipper holds my keys and cell and a host of other small items i always seemed to be losing before , and the large pocket is big enough to fit several medium sized paperbacks in . it 's perfect for everyday use , and will last forever . the `` backpack straps '' are comfortable and have never broken . i was so excited when i found this on amazon , and in every color ! before , the selection was red and black only , so this is fabulous ! buy this bag , you will love it ||| 1
i loved the look of the boot . the price was great . i guess you get what you pay for . they run a size small . there is also some sort of design flaw with the zipper function and location . you break out in a sweat trying to get the boots on and off . believe me , i tried . i really wanted to keep the boots based on the look . once on , they were really awkward to walk around in because the wedge had no give at all . i am pretty good in heels being in a band and always wearing some kind of trendy shoe . i tend to be pretty easy . i just could not make these work ! sorry ||| 0
with a title like 'swirl skirt , ' you 'd expect the fabric to be able to , well , swirl . but the fabric is stiff and not very comfortable . plus , the cut ( of the size 12 at least ) was awkward , giving my tummy a bubble that was n't even there . and the last thing i want is for my tummy to look bigger than it actually is . so i do n't recommed this item ||| 0
warning ! ! ! can not use button features to operate zen player because leather case is way too tight ! you can hardly get the player into the case so no amount of time or breaking in period is going to fix the problem . sadly , it 's like having a pair of shoes that are so tight you have to remove them so you can walk .

my 9 year old nephew told me he wanted `` under armour '' for christmas . i had no idea what he was talking about . i asked - `` under arm deoderant '' ? `` undershirt '' ? i was ever the un-cool aunt for not knowing what he wanted . i found out that 3 of my friends experienced the same thing . ; ) the shirt runs very tight , and even though my nephew is smaller for his age , the large just barely fit him . he asked for a second one for his birthday ( and so did my sister , so she could get the shirt off of him and wash it ) . the kid loves it , and if he gives it 5 stars , so do i . ||| 1
they run much smaller than birkenstocks . i sent the size 44 back ( which is comfy in the comparable model in birkenstocks ; is it the boston ? ) and got the 45 and it still feels small . the upper is ok , the shoe is n't the best made thing but is adequate ; it 's just the size thing that bothered me ||| 0
this was called learning the hard way not to believe the hype and not to buy shoes on line . the fit was awful , there is no cushioning to speak of in the soles and other than looking good off my feet these shoes are useless ||| 0
in the picture it shows of this bra it looked as if it was low cut and comfortable , but it shows it in a smaller size than the one i wear , so once i opened the box i was very suprised that it was so huge and cumbersome . it could not possibly be worn with a low cut top , which is why i bought it . if you were a size 34d or above , beware ||| 0

used the jump rope maybe 3-4 times and the handle broke off , you would expect a quality jump rope for the price but do n't count on it . then again it could have just been mine ||| 0
i was a bit dissapointed , i know its my fault , i did n't pay to much attention to the tag that is not the color they show the one you are ordering , it should be the same thing you 're looking physically the thing you 're gon na buy ! ! ! i saw this beautifull gray/orange stripes , and got green /white stripÈs . its very easy to put a picture of the product ! ! regard ||| 0
if you are a grandma on a budget , it can be difficult to find useful items for grandsons . i thought that this was a good buy at $ 7.99 for my 11-year old grandson for either his birthday or christmas . i would have given five stars , but there was not a complete list of teams offered ||| 1
it 's thin , so you can wear something over it . and it helps keep the chill out . i wear it cycling and golfing ||| 1
i love the feel and multiple spaces available the only problem/fear is that i have had things fall out of it when snapped and string tight . i would give it a 5 star if there was a zipper option to keep items secured ||| 1
these are comfortable slippers that -- with composite soles -- can take you out on the deck , to the front steps or even your driveway to pick up the morning newspaper . your feet will stay warm but not uncomfortably so . they 're even nice to wear when temps are a little higher because the clog design fits loosely at the heal so you can let your feet `` breath '' a little fresh air . nice value for the price ||| 1
these underwear were supposed to be size 34 , but i could barely shimmy them up over my legs . the fit was so tight that i could not wear them , even though all my other underwear is size 34 and fits fine . they are also made of a very thin and flimsy grade of cotton , and the fly does not provide enough overlap to keep everything where it belongs . if you must try these , buy them at least 2 sizes larger - but you would do better with another product ||| 0
it has a very loose fit and i feel a little silly , but pulling it out of the package i totally forgot how exactly this thing should look on me . it is made like a very unflattering potato sack sadly ||| 0
bought this boot for varying terrain and temperature conditions . it is stable , comfortable , provides good traction , and is warm without being sweaty . i would strongly recommend this boot . ||| 1
good quality . beautiful color . however had a side zipper which my husband did n't like as much as a top zipper ||| 1
this is a fine leather bag , beautiful , comfortable ! i bought on the mfr website and saved the shipping . its a wonderful product of quality and craftsmanship ! a must have ||| 1
oh my gosh ! i was so excited to see this item . my 15 year old and all of his buddies are big fans of napoleon dynamite and this t-shirt is an exact replica of the one worn during the famous election rally dance ! i will be a hit on valentine 's day with this gift ! ||| 1
these are lightweight cotton thermals at a good price . i wear a large in most shirts and the large size for these fits snug , especially after a wash , which is how i like it for wearing as an undershirt . if you 're buying for outerwear , you might consider going a size larger . shipping was n't 'amazon quick ' but it was reasonable - about a week if i remember right ||| 1
these shoes exceeded my expectations , in that they are very lightweight . the soles are made of some kind of stiff foam instead of solid rubber . time will tell how it wears compared to rubber , but the shoes are noticeably lighter than the last pair i owned . they look good , they are very comfortable -- very little , if any , break-in time . if you like the look , it 's a safe buy -- you wo n't be disappointed with the build and feel ||| 1
most sneakers these days come in two varieties -- they 're huge athletic clod-hoppers for teenieboppers , or they 're white keds or orthotic shoes for old ladies . this sneaker is the best compromise on the market today . it 's youthful without being for the young . light-weight , low-profile , wide enough for a thick sock , and it 'll get you compliments everywhere you go . my first pair is in black , and wow , they are stylish . today i wore them out shopping , and my back started hurting before my feet did . my one objection is this supposedly 'squishy ' foot bed . i do n't know if my shoes were missing that part or what , but i found the sole to be hard and inflexible . they were still _comfortable_ but it was n't like putting your feet on pillows or anything . if you do prefer a squishier footbed , i recommend a thin insert , so as not to squish your toes . i 'm not sure if they would perform well for athletics -- i 'm going to be saving mine for errands and casual nights out , but i want these in every color ||| 1
i was unable to return the item because of restrictions imposed by their return policy i made a mistake by buying i ||| 0
if you see the description : made in italy , be careful ! they are made in india . i have written to amazon to let them change . but if you still see made in italy , be careful ! everybody knows the difference ||| 0
the moondoggies are very comfy and cute as can be ! perfect for wearing to the park with the kids but nice enough to veture out in the evening ... i am buying another pair . ||| 1
the socks are very lightweight , probably would be ok for summer use but not for work or books . they were just ok . i would not purchase agai ||| 0
i wrote a rave review of these the day i got them . they were absolutely terrific and gave me purchase doing yoga on a slippery rug . however , the next time i wore them for a longer session , they got stretched out . my toes kept falling out of them and they became twisted around my feet and just generally got in the way . i put on a new pair for another session and when doing any lunges or poses with my legs in a wide stance , they were very uncomfortable . oh well . the `` concept '' is great , but they do n't really work unless you 're doing very little movement . i wish someone would come up with something like this that does the job ||| 1
i am a product junkie and i never would have believed i could fit all my stuff in this bag , but i did ! this bag is amazing and takes up so much less space than the assorted bags i had been using ! i am getting one of these for each of my sisters.. ||| 1
i was looking for a durable checkbook cover that would last for years , yet was n't going to take years to pay for ! ( ha ! ha ! ) this is a nice checkbook cover for the money . my only complaint is that it needs to have a `` tab '' to keep your check register open to the page you are working on . however , it does have a `` loop '' to keep a pen inside , you should desire to do so . all in all , a good buy ||| 1
the cap is nice and presumably does what it is suppose to do by keeping my hair out of my face . however , the stitching at the seam at the back of the cap began coming apart from the day that i first used it . it hasnt torn completely ... yet . nevertheless , i would think that putting a skull cap on once with my short hair would cause a tear so sooon . i wouldnt suggest this produc ||| 0
1 . packaging was shabby . 2 . the finishing was pathetic with threads hanging out . 3 . the quality and feel of the cloth was the worst i have ever seen . 4 . dont be deceived by the pictures . 5 . the end product is not worth a gift or personal use nor 25 % of the actual cost ||| 0
these are exactly what i was looking for . i 've been wearing this type of ear muff for 20 years . everytime i break or lose a pair i spend months looking for its replacement . after i received my first pair , i ordered enough to last me another 20 years . i hate the around your neck ear muffs so popular these days . they are uncomfortable and they cost more ||| 1
we have a big smiling rubber rat in the state store where i work , but he is n't nearly as menacing as this sucker ! in fact 's he 's kinda friendly . this guy 's a beast ... blood red eyes , sharp claws , looks like he 'd take your throat if you slipped and fell in the bathroom . no ordinary broom neccesary here , friends , no , what you need is a can of mase and a nightstick . buy this guy , set him in the windows of a dark room , and call the cops . god knows they need some useful stuff to do at night besides drink coffee and play video games . would get more stars , but he 's damn expensive ||| 0
i just got these and love them . my only complaint is that they pinch/are a little narrow , even though i do n't have wide feet or regularly wear wide shoes . the dark red color is a little deeper than the picture , but that is a good thing if you want to wear these in both winter and summer . if you 're gon na buy red shoes or any other colors available , these are a great choice ||| 1
ca n't believe how true to size they are . they 're quite easy to move in , and they 're simple and beautiful . not at all cheap-looking for the price . i expected less and got more ||| 1
this was my second time ordering a dickies jacket and being disappointed , i will not do it again . the zipper gets stuck on a flap of material almost everytime i zip or unzip it . i contacted andrew christian over ninety days ago by e-mail and i was ignored . today i decided to send him a message through amazon and found out it was to late . i thought that the time limit was 180 days . i like everything else about the jacket , but this problem has cost me a lot of time and frustration , there must be a better brand for my money somewhere out there ||| 0
i love this skirt . i wear it with my `` live a little '' denim jacket , so cute . i find it to be really figure flattering . i ordered a size 6 and it fit perfect . nice to find a denim skirt that 's a little different than the other zillions out there ||| 1
i am picky about the kind of sock i put on me my son 's feet . his feet have been sized as extra wide ( ! ! ) and these socks fit wonderfully , in his size , without being stretched tight . i love the high cotton content the cushioned soles . these are well made socks i will be buying from this brand when it 's time for the next size up ||| 1
i ordered these shoes for my wedding , so you can imagine my nervousness . i received them within a week and fell in love ! i 've shown them to my bridal party and my mother and have received nothing but raves ! even at the shoe repair where i had no-skids put on them and the dress shop where i had a fitting no one could take their eyes off my shoes ! order a 1/2 size smaller ||| 1
i bought two of these bags so far . both have failed at the plastic fastener , one arm just snapped in no time . the bag itself is ok , but the plastic parts on the belt are really cheap ... i wont buy a third one . ||| 0
i wore this shirt for one day every other week and after five months the collar points have worn through and the white material underneath is showing through . it 's a blue shirt so i ca n't wear it to work now . unacceptable in a shirt of this price ||| 0
the fanny pack looks nice but the belt did not adjust to be small enough for my hips . i am a 5'6 '' 120 lb . small boned female . the company offered to exchange it , however did not offer any others with cell phone holder . now i will have to pay return shipping plus 4.95 restocking fee to return this item . i did not see the information to learn of this fee before my purchase and am not happy to learn it now ||| 0
i love this shoe ! it 's a perfect heel height , classic pointed toe , comfortable design with coverage enough to enclose even a wider foot . perfectly proportioned with all-day comfort . if i win lotto , i plan to order every color with spares in case it 's ever discontinued . the natural leather is lovely , but scuffs easily . i strongly recommend buffing with neutral polish or saddle soap/oil to give it a bit of durability . highly recommended , even for wider feet ! ||| 1
the shoes are comfortable . easy to wear and feel great with or without socks ! ||| 1
these boots look good with jeans . can be loose , but comfortable with thick socks ||| 1
i 'm very satisfied with this purchase . the jeans are great quality for the price . however , it was not stated that they would be the ( very ) long length that they were . i had to alter them , which was an inconvenience ||| 1
i am a bit disappointed in the quality . it looked like a possible reject off the factory line . there are threads uncut and the velcro was sewed wrong in one of the side pockets . you really should not expect too much . you may find something better quality in some of your local cheap department store chain . ||| 0
originally ordered a completely different model armband for 15 bux . got this one ... ... we 'll see if my 80 gb video will fit ... ..doubt it ... .amazon ... .bad call on this seller son ! ! ! ||| 0
these were ordered for my son for regular sledding and tubing activities . he thinks they are warm and comfortable - not stiff like similar snow pants from other manufacturers . they are a great value ||| 1

i have a small head and it makes it look huge ! maybe if i had a big head it would look alright pfff ||| 0
i bought some of these - i find they have a large seam on the right side which digs into my skin and is quite uncomfortable . other than that they are ok , but because of this i mostly wear these inside out ||| 0
this backpack is sturdy , good looking , very functional and at at least a third of the price of other similar backpacks i looked at , i 'm completely satisfied with this purchase ||| 1
very happy with this product . they are substantial so they are `` suitable '' for a medium or large and not someone who is small . delivery was fast and it was well packed . shipping was included , though i did n't realize it until the end of the ordering process . ||| 1
this shoe is great . it even came with an extra pair of shoe strings that had a different design . the only thing that i felt it lacked was extra comfort . i wear skechers and have done so for years and i have had other styles that were more comfortable although this was not top comfort it was definitely wearable and did not hurt my feet . it was a great deal that i just could n't pass up and definitely worth the price : ||| 1
the sweater i received was extremely thin : i had expected something more like an ll bean cardigan , which i dearly love . i was wrong . what do i do now ? roger hampton ( 503 ) 293-5655 ov10abronco @ juno.com ||| 0
i actually had to send this back cause of the size . they run really small . ||| 0
i ordered a large and assumed it was adult size ... this large was like a girls size large ... .very small sizing i returned the sweater.. ||| 0
i was impressed by the look of this bag . it really looked like it would seal the contents well . unfortunately , it did not . i tried several times , and each time , the contents of the bag were soaked ! fortunately i tested it out with just some cash for a day at the pool ... and only ended up with soggy money . if i had put my cell phone and watch in the bag , they would have been ruined . i do n't recommend it ||| 0
i actually purchased a 9.5 and felt they were a little too big and then ordered a size 9 . the 9 did n't fit well the arch was too short , so i sent them back and kept the 9.5 . they are very nice , i 've been looking for a nice pair of boots for 5 years . i get a lot of compliments , from people of all ages ( 20-65 ) . not too young looking , not too old looking . they are the perfect boot . one little negative ... .i needed to put in a pad for the front part of my foot - not a lot of cushion . after that i can wear them all day long . i should have ordered them in brown ! ! ||| 1
: ( these will give you pain . i bought these shoes because they looked rather cute in the picture , and considering they were n't just a $ 5 pair of shoes , i thought they would be somewhat comfortable , if not doable , to wear . buyer beware : these shoes will cut your heels . they run a little small , so i suggest getting at least a half size larger . if you want to do anything besides sitting and looking pretty , do not buy these shoes . i walked for less than 2 minutes before they started tearing and blistering my heels . they also are a little tight on the toes , so if you have a wide foot , these definitely are not for you . i have to admit , they are darling and cute , but they are not worth the pain . ||| 0
initially i was going to order several items from andrew christian , until i saw their shipping prices at checkout . $ 2 shipping on each $ 4 tee-shirt was more than excessive , they were going to charge me $ 20 shipping on a $ 42 order ! i canceled most of the items , only ordering a belt and a tee . shipping was still ~ 50 % surcharge . received my order yesterday and found that the belt is defective . the buckle is on backwards ( no , it 's not reversible ... ) plus the material of the belt itself is damaged by a frayed hole . it is n't worth the shipping cost hassle to send it back , i 'll probably just throw it away - but i did learn something . i will never deal with andrew christian again ! i you choose to , please pay attention to the shipping charges when you check out - you may decide to revise your order ||| 0
i just received this bag today and i am absolutely in love with it.this bag looks alot more expensive then it is and the inside is huge ! ! ! with a zip pocket and additional large pocket and smaller one that is perfect for my mp3 player . my husband got it 100 % right with this little surprise . so if you enjoy a large bag that looks great on your arm this one is it expecially for the price ! ! ! ||| 1
this shoe is n't as comfortable as my other keds shoes . it also does n't breath as well . if you have a tendency to develope hot feet , this would n't be a good purchase for you . it also needs the new insoles that the newer keds shoes have ||| 0
i am solidly a size medium , but i was swimming in this jacket . i think it is more of an xl . i 'd say the medium is for someone 5'10 '' and 250lbs ||| 0
the wallet was a gift for my daughter 's boyfriend . he loved the wallet , the leather , the design , style , and sleek look of the fossil wallet . it was a great purchase and a good value ||| 1
comfortable . if elastic waist degrades over time ( not known yet , but has happened to other pajamas ) , there is no back-up draw-string . as with all flannel pjs , easily tangles with flannel sheets ||| 1
for the price , this product should receive the cruciatus curse ad infinitum . the material is all synthetic ( i was expecting a wool blend , though the ad said nothing about what the hat and scarf were made of ) , the relatively loose weave means it will not last as long , and one of the tassels fell off the scarf after just one wearing . i dislike being taken advantage of just so i can make my daughter happy . she is disappointed as well . it was a lot of money to pay to get the hogwarts crest on a patch that was n't even fully embroidered . j.k. rowling should be upset that english woolens , with which this product will be associated by people who are not in the know , will acquire such a poor image because of the greed of the licensing people ||| 0
my husband loves this coat . he wears it all winter . if you are someone that doesnt like a bulky exceptionally warm lined coat this is it . he is uncomfortable in something like down because it is too sweaty but this is perfect . warm enough and lightweight and comfortable . this is the second one he has purchased . ||| 1
i could not believe the quality in these shoes ... horrible ! the material feels and sounds like cardboard or paper . they have an awful smell and are uncomfortable . i bought chinese shoes in china town for $ 2 , they were wonderfully comfortable , still smelled funny , but they were awesome.these are not ! ||| 0
i purchased this robe for my boyfriend as a christmas gift ... and i wish i would have purchased one for myself as well ! this robe is made of the softest , warmest materials , but is extremely light-weight , unlike most robes . `` luxurious '' is the perfect adjective . ||| 1
they are perfect for kids daily lunches . would like to order more but do n't where to start . lost all the ordering information ||| 1
the pants are not juniors ' , they are women 's pants that go up past your waistline when you wear them ||| 0
they were not as heavy weight as stated..to me they seem more like a regular t-shirt..and the size seems to be a little smaller than norm..after first washing , they really shrink.. i will not buy any more . ||| 0
i purchased the white entrance wedge sandal by steve madden from amaon.com and i love them ! they are so cute and they go with everything ! perfect fun shoe for the beach , or for a night out ! people compliment me when i wear them and you will not be dissapointed ! they are so comfortable and did i say that i love them ! : ||| 1
sorry , there is no way this shirt is supposed to last even your first five months ... runs too small and was completely to thin/sheer . can be seen straight through ||| 0
this listing ise n't correct . item nts1 is a nylon tank top shirt , not a t-shirt ||| 0
i wear this shirt waiting tables and i reccomend it to anyone . when washed it is wrinkle free and can survive many washings . the larger size is very roomy and sleeve length is appropriate for long arms . i only wish it came in a broad collar instead of just a point color , but still an excellent shirt ||| 1
i could not find these slippers in our local stores . i had two pair that were worn out and wanted exactly the same item . i ordered them , they arrived and i love them . it was a very easy , customer friendly process ||| 1
shirts are what i had expected and the service was grea ||| 1
good construction and material for the price . size seems a bit different in l vs. r unless i am more asymmetrical now than i noticed before ? nice sheepskin material . i am hoping this lasts longer than the previous moc i purchased by acorn ||| 1
i purchased these about 3 months ago . they have very little arch support and very little other support elsewhere . i have been wearing them perhaps 2-3 times a week to the office and home . they are already ripping in the back . i would n't recommend them ; however , i do get many compliments about how cute they are . ||| 0
i still love this bra ! it 's great for casual wear , sleeping etc . it does solve the back fat problem , however there is no lift and separate for me . i 'm going to try the underwire version of this bra to see if it helps . it is an extremely comfortable bra that feels great on ! i bought a l for the band size , but there 's just not quite enough coverage for my ds ||| 1
i have started water walking in the fitness center pool and found i was slipping enough to bother me . this shoe fits like a glove and is very inexpensive to use . i would recommend it to anyone desiring to use it for this purpose or any other water related activity . i am certain it would be great at the beach , etc ||| 1
this strap is thinner than those used in yoga classes . it is sharp on the arch when held there for poses . i would not purchase another one . ||| 0
these sunglasses are all right . they were a little crooked , but still cool.. ||| 1
love it ... love it ... love it ! ! ! every football fan should have one . it is perfect for tailgating . this is the only site i could find it . great price and the free shipping is a great deal . it also shipped really fast , faster then it had originally said . ||| 1
the shoes were n't the color that i wanted them to be . to me , there cheap and are over priced ! the quality is not good . they can easily be scuffed . am definitely returning them ! ! ||| 0
i will be returning this item to the vendor . i rec 'd . this skirt for my daughter and thought it had a colorful embroidery . instead i find the word baske in a mirrored embroidered image . not sure what baske stands for . i guess it 's their idea of 'short for basketball ' . whatever ! you ca n't see the pic clearly . i 'm out the shipping cost on this one . what a bummer ! ||| 0
so glad i did n't have to choose between the convenience of carrying all my cards and the bulkyness of a holder big enough to accommodate them . this wallet is slimline and holds all my cards . it 's been 6 months since i wrote this review , and i only become more satisfied with this wallet . all my cards are easily accessed , viewed and i know immediately if one is missing . the leather is silky soft and durable . people have been asking where i found this item . i think it 's the best i 've ever purchased ||| 1
sorry to give such a bad review but i ca n't in good conscience give a better one . i did this workout one time with the 8 lb . ball and have not been able to do any kind of exercise since . i am entering my second week of taking pain killers for my messed-up lower back . there are several segments ( including ab work ) where the ball is held with straight arms and moved from the down position to up over the head as well as twisting side-to-side . while doing these moves , i kept thinking that they really did not seem sound for that much weight . sure enough by that evening i was dying ! perhaps they 'd be ok if you used the lightest weight ball . i am in good shape and have actually been doing the p90x extreme workouts . i am accustomed to using 20-40 lb . weights and do tae kwon do and i do not have any back problems . i snatched this up when i finally found it for a good price and did it on an off day . just be forewarned-it is really easy to hurt your back with this workout . i love all the other firm workouts but will never do this one again . additionally , when i received this from amazon the ball was misshapen the dvd case was broken from the weight of the ball . they immediately sent a replacement which was damaged in exactly the same way ||| 0
i did not expect the jockey to not show any lines but there was absolutely no difference between these and a regular pair of bikini . these should be renamed jockey show-everything bikini ||| 0
i purchased this case after getting tired of waiting for creatives leather case to become available . as far as appearance , it is well crafted . when it comes to functinality , it stinks . here are the problems i have with it : 1 ) there is no hole for the microphone , 2 ) the hole for the headphone jack is not lined up properly , 3 ) the charger and sync adapter brick ca n't fully engage the player because of the leather straps , so it is easily disengaged by the slightest movement . this is ok at home , but try using this in the car ( if you want to charge while you listen ) ; it falls out with every turn you make . this case was not designed with much thought about the functions of the zen player ||| 0
the sneakers are great . my son loves the wheels on the side ||| 1
i purchasese the red ones , and i love them . they really go well with many different colors . i was really pleasantly surprised ||| 1
i 'm a pretty sexy girl and these so called panties are just about too sexy for me . ooooweee do i feel hot when i have 'em on . levi 's , shorts , dress or trucker 's overhauls , it makes no difference . the whole rest of the world might not know what you have on under there , but you 'll know and that 's enough to add a certain blush to your face , let me tell you . they made me feel ready for bed all day long ||| 1
i bought this sweatshirt last year and it is one of the most comfortable articles of clothing i own . i am a little ashamed to admit that i do n't use it when exercising , its so comfortable i use it to lounge around the house . ||| 1
i ordered the 50 's style rockabilly polka dot dress in a 1x . i am a full sized woman with a small waist and a well endowed chest . the cup size for the 1x looked to be about a c cup at the most . i sent back the 1x for the 3x in which the cupsize looked to be a d , the dress has no support what so ever in the chest area so a bra is a must for heavier chested women . the waist and back area was way too large in the 3x . i was not only displeased with the fit but the quality of the material is poor as well . the dots are screenprinted on so after a few washes they will begin to crack and fade , it does say handwash ( but even still some of the dots are already lighter than others ) . i 'm giving the dress two stars because the style of the dress is really nice and if you can get it to fit the right way its not a bad price at all , but it 's definitely not a dress that your going to have around for a long time . ||| 0
i got two pairs of these for my kids and they could hardly walk after wearing these . unless the bottom of your feet are tough i would not get these ||| 0
beware : this bra will increase the appearance of your breasts a full cup size or more ! the only draw back to acquiring this bra is slyly wearing it without family and co-workers knowing something 's up . this bra is made from good materials . the cups are thick and smooth and the straps are study and comfortable . the liquid is ample but not noisy or lumpy . the cup fabric is itchy at first , but a handwash in woolite will fix that . the only problem i have , is that this bra does n't push the breasts up to the cup ! i prefer low-cut blouses and would feel more confident in a `` push-up '' design . otherwise , it 's a truly effective bra to give you non-surgical results ||| 1
i had the worst feet ! i ran my first marathon in may , and i was in a panic . on my long runs in march and the first part of april i was going to quit ! my feet hurt so bad ! i was training on a lot of downhill runs , and therefore landed on the balls of my feet . ouch ! i think i would have been better off to run in nothing , than to wear what i had , which was a top of the line shoe . i was desparate ! i found these asics gt 2110 men 's shoe ( i 'm a woman ) and i felt 100 % better ! ! i had support plus the cushion i needed for my sore feet , what an awesome shoe ! ! i finished my marathon in them , i could n't have done it without them . ||| 1
if your name were johnny damon , maybe . but you 're bagging groceries at the star market for $ 7.25/hour . is this jersey really worth a day 's pay to you ? the chicks are n't gon na be fooled into thinking you 're on the team . the sox wo n't vote you a world series share . your mom 's gon na throw it in the dryer and shrink the beejesus out of it , and you 're gon na wish you had that money back when your buddy tommy is selling his old malibu . ||| 0
i purchased this dress to be the maid of honor in my best friends wedding . it arrived quickly , looked great , and was an awesome price . it would be hard to beat this great deal ||| 1
these are very pretty without too much fluff . the leather bottoms are padded which helps your feet especially if your home is on concrete slab . i love them ||| 1
this is the standard style from the new line of performance jocks from bike . this waistband is slightly smaller than the traditional 3 inch , but very comfortable . the pouch fits nice and snug giving you perfect support and the leg straps do n't twist or bind . easy to launder and pretty inexpensive . i got rid of my old worn-out jocks and bought a few of these new ones . they 're masculine , modern and comfortable , but not something that would be embarassing putting on or taking off at the gym ( like an orange or blue jock ) . a good buy . comes in a black version , that is also great . i 've worn for working out , and just around town - good for both . ||| 1
since these jeans were ordered as a gift for someonelse , i can not give my own opinion of the jeans , other than to say i received the jeans in a timely manner and that the size and color was exactly what i had ordered ||| 1
this is the first time i 've ordered shoes without trying them on , but these shoes were exactly what i was looking for and could n't find in the department stores in my size . i know the name naturalizer so knew they would be good quality . they fit perfect , and the price was right ! thank you amazon ||| 1
this is a really comfortable , and it 's very protective , especially in high winds . it keeps you war , and it looks good , i personally added new patches to my jacket , its looks really good ! ! ! this is a good buy ! ! you should get this jacket ||| 1
these are the most warm and comfortable slippers . i would recommend these to everyone ||| 1
i 'd been shopping for a pair of running shoes and have tried on various brands . these shoes surpassed others in fit , support , and comfort . i 'm so glad kayano comes in wide sizes , because it fits my feet perfectly ! i highly recommend ! ||| 1
the nine west botamy boots are comfortable and really well made . the leather is very soft also . even though the toe is very pointed , these boots are still comfortable . amazon has a great price on these boots ||| 1
even though i favor leather , every once in a while a pleather product comes along that i really appreciate . well , these boots sadly are not in that category . the pleather started cracking after i wore the boots x3 ; the lining was poorly cut to begin with and started unraveling . the sad part is that for the amount of money that i spend on these boots , i could have bought a pair of leather ones after x-mas ||| 0
got these slippers for my man for christmas . they are buttery soft , the fit is true to size and they are not lined with something to heavy and hot for the feet . can be worn barefoot or with socks . great for a quick dash outside . i would recommend these slippers and this seller ||| 1
the crib sheets were soft , the service fast and they fit the pack and play mattress ||| 1
i was disappointed with the shoes when i received them . on the website , the shoes looked gold in color and were described as gold , but when i received the shoes they were beige . i am sorry to say that i could not wear the shoes . ||| 0
my daughter simply loves this item . very handy , compact , and versatile . a great wonderful gift for anyone 's daughter . ||| 1
i love these shoes , they are totally cute . the only draw back is they are kinda like satin over paper . they are n't as soft as i thought they would be , but i great buy none the less . ||| 1
girlfriend loves these gloves , they were thicker than her original fingerless globes , however she complained about the thumbs . she wish they had a better way to hold them on the thumb , and when not in use to restrain it back ||| 1
i bought this for me , but the size ran small and it is not of a very good weight . i have a daughter that they did fit and she wanted to wear them under things so she became the proud owner . the shirts are not by any means high or even good quality ||| 0
i ordered 2 wristlets - a brown and a leopard print . i was sent two brown wristlets , the return process was difficult , and when i returned the product i did not receive a refund or the correct product ! ! ||| 0
my first pregnancy i tried several styles of belts , most of which had a wide band in back . i am short , have a short midriff , and am overweight , so wider belts would roll from the top down . i never had that problem with this belt . unfortunately , this pregnancy i am entering my 3rd trimester and have finally out grown the 1x belt , and the store i purchased it from is now closed . i was thrilled when i found this on amazon.com in a larger size . i recommend making it little snug in the mornings and then loosening it throughout the day as needed . the most appealing feature for me is that this band is completely adjustable to give you the support you need for the different activities you will be doing throughout the day . any time you start needing the extra support , just slightly tighten the side straps . when you start relaxing or if the belt starts feeling a little tight , just loosen it up a bit . it 's quick and easy to work with , and if one side needs more support than the other , just make that one side a bit more snug . it 's awesome ! i am a technology education specialist , so i 'm on my feet for , many times , 16 hrs a day training and supporting hospitals with their new computer programs . i could n't have survived even my first trimester without this belt . i raise it a little higher in the back so that i have complete lower back support and belly support . there were days when i forgot to wear my belt that i almost could n't walk after only 4 hrs of work due to lower back pain that would eventually extend down to my fanny and legs . my legs would litterally give out from underneath me until i could rub and relax my lower back for a while . when you are working with doctors in the surgery room or doing rounds with them this is not a good thing . as long as i wore my belt , i never had a problem . i strongly recommend this product ||| 1
not comfortable . the `` thong '' between your toes is too thick and too tight . if you are looking for toeless , this is not the way to go . try dkny hosiery instead . expensive , but worth it for the comfort factor and they are very durable ||| 0
horrible . must go through hell to return it too , they wo n't give you back the shipping to send it to you , just the cost of the item . do not buy . do not recommend ||| 0
they were not as heavy weight as stated..to me they seem more like a regular t-shirt..and the size seems to be a little smaller than norm..after first washing , they really shrink.. i will not buy any more . ||| 0
my son loved these jeans . the jeans were very comfortable . the best thing about them was that because my son is so thin the elastic adjustments were perfect ||| 1
this bra is definately not for the over b cup set . the openings are too big and you 'd be better off wearing nothin ||| 0
with the sale and promotional rate applied . this is a great shoe ||| 1
this bag is perfect as a commuter bag on my bike . the cell phone pocket is very accessible and the bag is large enough to hold a change of clothes , but not so large everything gets lost inside ||| 1
i really liked my tote bag . what i liked most was the variety of colors and the size of the bag which is pretty durable considering that i use mine to tote my books in college . the only thing that i didnt like was the outrageous amount for shipping . let me tell you when i say the company sent the bag `` stuffed '' in a small manilla envelope but yet charged me what almost 6 or 7 dollars in shipping when in fact the enevelope probably costed about 50 cents to ship . that was foul ! despite everything about the shipping cost the bag is a good bag and i guess i shouldnt complain as much ||| 1
these are stylish and nice and perfect to wear under a pair of cutoff levi 's . my cutoffs are so faded , so frayed , so , well you know . so when i peal them off to reveal this butterfly lace up panty ( in black with the pick laces on the back ) it 's like an instant transformation from outdoor girl to bedroom girl . we only had two colors at our lingerie party , white and the black and pink models , but i can imagine all the colors would be nice too . ||| 1
if your loved one is a beautiful 5'7 '' , 130 lb slender lady like mine , forget about this piece of clothing . if , however , she is a 5'1 '' 180 lb gorgeous `` petite '' girl , this might just be the excitement inducer you are looking for . you 'll have lots of fun , first trying to put it on her , then trying to use the slits which are in all the wrong places , and then finally to remove it from her body without injuring her or yourself . fun that will come after that is purely optional.. ||| 0
this is a fabulous find ! my husband loves henley shirts ... but , they have to be just the right fabric weight and sleeve length . after many failed attempts , i finally found the perfect shirt . great look , great feel and most importantly my husband likes it too ||| 1
i am totally satisfied with the merchant and the product ||| 1
let me assure anyone who is even remotely thinking of buying these shoes ... ... ... .do it ! they are not only beautiful but as high as they are , they are extremely comfortable . the detail is way more beautiful in person as they are on the website . my favorite shoe of the summer ||| 1
these are very good quality slippers , comfortable well worth the price . ||| 1
purchased this for my girlfriend . told me that fits well and was very happy with this . i am glad to get such a good price on them too ||| 1
very comfortable - looks great - makes it easy to move around in bed ||| 1
shoe is comfortable but the description says off white or white with beige . which leads you to think the color is mostly white . the true color is neither ! there is absolutely no white in these shoes . i purchased these shoes because i needed some white off/white shoes not beige shoes . no i did not return them it 's too much of a hassel to return things so i kept them and i have worn them once but do not like the color at all . the style is not as cute as her others but they are still a great bargain . the materials are an excellent quality . if you like beige earthtones you will like these shoes ||| 0
backpack is light when empty , yet strong to curry the load of books to school . side pocket for bottle very handy . top pocket for cd player or small easy to reach items such as keys , very helpful and practical . i like the base of the backpack being dark color so it does n't look dirty from use ||| 1
these pants have a tendency to split horizontally for almost no reason at all . if they split alont the seam that would be one thing but to ctross a seam and just practically explode even when they fit loosely can only mean rotten fabric and that is what you will get when you buy these . i have lost the 3 pairs i biught to the self same calamity and always in public . please save yourself the trouble . by the way the lee version of these pants also do the same thing . be afraid be very afraid . ||| 0
do not waste you money on this piece of sh** case not only it is loose it ; s bad quality i just got it two days ago and the arm band came apart , and i have no idea what this white thing is that it comes with it is useless . what a waste of money . ||| 0
the quality of this product can not in any way compare to the genuine apple ipod covers . it is very flimsy , does not fit correctly , does not come with a belt clip and most importantly leaves the display area wide open to scratches and breakage . that 's right ; there is no plastic or glass protection for the display area . there is a reason why this product does not cost as much as other ipod covers . that 's because it is of poor quality . also , when you calculate the cost of the cover , plus the cost of shipping it , you do not get a bargin . as a matter of fact , if someone gave me this product for free , i would not accept it because , like i stated earlier , it provides no protection . ||| 0
like the last reviewer said it 's tricky to put on using the little straps that go around your bra ... that is a fact . a front closure bra might help some . even though i ( finally and after a lot of cussing ) got the straps around my bra , the garment still gapped underneath the bra on both sides of the back strap , which is right in the middle . that is the only place in the back there is a strap to hold the whole back of the girdle up . then there is one strap under each arm that goes around your bra there . it pulled down on my bra there causing scrunching . there is one strap in front in the middle too , which i do n't need to use . the directions say to attach the spanx/straps to the bra and 'step ' into the garment . right ! ! much easier said than done . for it to stay up properly in the back i think it needs straps not only right in the middle , but also to the left and right of the middle , in between that and the under the arm ones . i ca n't really use mine ... a waste of money , i already removed the tags and ca n't send it back . i have another spanx that is the same but without the little straps and i ca n't use that either , as it does creep down in the back . unless you do n't move that is . so altogether i have spent about $ 150 for spanx stuff i ca n't use . there must be a better way to fasten those straps ... .maybe sturdy snaps or velcro or something , and they should fasten right to the top edge of the garment , as it is they hook half an inch down on the inside and that causes the top edge to tend to roll out and cause bulk there . not happy ||| 0
these shoes are so cute and sexy ! high heels makes a girl look so much longer and leaner ! beware though , if you 've never bought naughtys i would go to a store and try them on first b4 buying online . i wear 8 's in everything but these , i wear 7.5 . love them ! ||| 1
classic wedding tuxedo . excellent fabric and cut . the tuxedo was changed to single breasted suit after my approval . ||| 1
the boots arrived packaged in their original packaging and individually wrapped inside . these boots will never disappoint ... they are fun , warm , comfy and stylish ! dont forget to spray with silicon before taking them out ||| 1
i just love different and odd things . i love to give people gifts that no one else have.thanks ||| 1
this is a nice case if you are looking for something compact . i have a kodak easy share digital camera and it fits perfect inside . the case has a nice size front pouch and 2 side pouches for easy storage ||| 1
it 's awful . the s size is too big for me ( my waistline is 34 and in the sizing chart it says `` size s fits 26-36 '' ) so i end up cut it and sew it back so it can fit on me . then after 3 days of wearing it , the velcro is messed up , it can not attached together anymore . the costumer service is an answering machine ( i tried several times to call the costumer service , and only get the machine answer my call ) . i can not return the item , because it says its illegal to return this kind of item . so my advise , dont buy this item or you 'll be sorry . ||| 0
seriously , went into the store to find new running shoes , possibly the air 360 . was wearing shoxs in the store . threw them away immediately . these are the best shoes i 've worn in a long while . i 'm one of those ppl that like to take off my shoes as soon as i get home . i forgot that these were on , they were that comfortable . i 'm a heavy , parttime runner . nothing over 5k as i am just starting again . they support my weight extremely well ||| 1
these shoes are so light that sometimes i forget i have them on . they are so comfortable than i do n't want to take them off . i have to walk a lot every day and i am not kidding when i said that any other pair of shoes make my feet sore after a few hours of use , but these shoes do the job to perfection . i highly recommend them ||| 1
i really wanted this product to work , but it really did n't help with my problem . i always have erect nipples no matter what and this really does n't fully flatten them , or make them less noticeable with t-shirts , etc ||| 0
i bought this hat for my 4 year old granddaughter for christmas . she loved it . the downside : the elastic stretch band on the inside of the hat was so tight that the hat would not sit on her head without popping off . we would have returned it but it was christmas morning and my granddaughter was thrilled with the concept of having a cowgirl hat . we ultimately solved the problem by cutting out the elastic band and the hat now fits just fine ! i guess the elastic band is supposed to make the hat fit various sized heads but it is beyond me how the hat would stay on anyone 's head ||| 0
dilvered quickly in time for christmas . sweatshirt was great quality ||| 0
this is saled as a baseball shoes but it is for american footbal . but the mistake goes more long , because the photo included shows a baseball shoes how you can observ in the marks of the sole ||| 0

i got these for christmas in 06 and they looked great on me . last week i took them to school and i put them in the small pouch of my backpack and at then at the end of the day i took them out at on of the sides had completley snaped in half.there was no way to repair them . these glasses look good but dont waste your money on these . really cheap . i am very unhappy . = ( ||| 0
i was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the items i ordered -- as well as receiving a 10 % discount coupon for my next order . thanks ||| 1
the earmuffs are very nice quality and the color was perfect for my daughter ||| 1
we received this product in a clear plastic molded container , however there were no instructions at all , nor was there any label . we immediately thought , this must not be a new product . not knowing exactly how to attach it to the psp or detach it , one of the clips has broken . we also have more questions - can the battery inside this charger be replaced ? if so , what kind is it ? i think we 'll be returning this product ||| 0
i agree . cup had too much left at the end and all i can say is pointy ||| 0
the boots were not what i expected . the pictures made the books look different then they actually were . they were exremely wide and the sizing was off . ||| 0
i was getting some boning too but didnt mind . this ensemble is a lot of fun to wear once its broken in . i wear mine all the time ||| 0
i bought this for my husband . we tried it in one car and it kept getting stuck in the lighter socket and the end kept coming off ( it was n't screwed very tightly and could n't be screwed tighter ) . in the other car it fit in the socket all right but every couple of minutes you had to adjust the radio station and even then the music came through fuzzy . also , if you turned the car off it does n't remember which station it was tuned to . we are going to return it to amazon , but i 'm not sure how as i do n't think they have an option for returning it as 'the product just is n't very good ! ' if you want something cheap and are ok with it not being particularly reliable then this is for you , but for hardcore music lovers , i suggest savinf up and investing in a better product . ||| 0
ordered a pair ... and they lost my first order . had to contact amazon to help . finally got order..and pants were too small . so..had to re order larger size . got pants in same size as last . wrote back saying i know have two pair of pants that are too small . first they denied sending wrong size..then later wrote back saying they did make a mistate and that new order in correct size was on its way with postage lables to send pants back . well a month later still have not recieved pants or lables . have wrote half a dozen emails asking for a reply and help..no reply . never had such poor customer service ||| 0
reliable brand of work pants in a good selection of colors is all we 're asking for ||| 1
we were disappointed when we received this because it showed up in a search with silk robes and pajamas and i guess i assumed tht it was silk . rather stiff and uncomfortable ||| 0
men here is a tip . if you want to please your lady , use a sexy thong instead . we love how a man looks in a thong ||| 0
the robe does not fit me . i wanted to return it , got a return item number , got busy , and did not get it in the mail soon enough . they have a strict 30 day return ploicy . nordstroms does not do this . i could exchange it there . sorry i got a job and not time for petty rules . i will go elsewhere next time ||| 0
thank you for this great gift for a baby shower states away that you made helpful and she loves i ||| 1
the shirt is of ok quality but the design is hard to see and will probaby wash off quickly . be sure to order a size bigger than you normally would as it is cut small . also my personal opinion is the shipping charge for this very light item is a little excessive ||| 0
i have been using this for awhile now . unlike some sports bras that are this supportive , it 's a lighter weight material/construction . i would n't say that there probably is n't something better out there and it is n't cheap - but it 's not bad . for my peers that have this 'issue ' , you know what i 'm talking about ! : ||| 1
my wife had one just like this for 15 years and it was time for a new one . this back is almost identical and better quality . shipping was very fast and it came exactly as i expected ||| 1
i bought a sweatshirt from them -- the tote was a `` freebie '' and too small for much use anyway . customer service was awful . they sent me the wrong size -- a man 's size , not the woman 's i was searching for ( and the photo had a woman wearing it ! she must have been an amazon ) . i returned it the next day and they refused to accept the return , saying it looked worn ||| 0
i bought these slippers for my mother , who is 5 years post stroke . she has difficulty keeping shoes and slippers on because she has no feeling in her left foot since her stroke . also she is always cold even when it is 80+ degrees outside . these slippers have been wonderful . they fit her well , they stay on and they keep her feet warm . when she wears these out will definitly by another pair ||| 1
for years , i wore asics . the gt , the cumulus , the nimbus . but i have to say , if you 're fan of any asics shoes named after clouds , you should try the trigon 4 . very similar , but cheaper . also they did not joke when they called it the ride . it has a very smooth transition and insane cushion , but a little more support than asics for those who are neutral gait yet a tad wanting in stabilization without all the weight . a big thumbs ( toes ? ) up ||| 1
i searched the internet for a particular type of sock that my son likes , but discovered they were no longer manufactured . so i went to amazon to see what they offered and decided to try the gold toe . the price was excellent and my son likes them very much . ( he 's very finicky about some things and it was a real `` if '' to try something new ) ... i 'm so happy that amazon offered them and at a price that meant it would not be a huge loss if they did n't work out . my son has looked at the price of this sock at some of the department stores nearby discovered that the amazon price is very good ; so now we know where to go when he needs some more . thank you , amazon ||| 1
i washed this garment according to the recommendation and it shrank about 2 sizes . . . to the point i can no longer wear it . bummer after just wearing it once ||| 0
at first glance , you 'll think these are great - but the wimpy elastic combined with the slippery fabric makes for panties that are constantly sliding off your butt . ||| 0
my mouth dropped when i received this item . the inside is like raw material and the piece that holds the money down is not easy to use . for clarity it has 2 outside pockets and no inside pockets ||| 0

i was givin this case for christmas and i thought it was great for the first month ... ... ... ... ... ... .then i took it off to get some dust off the screen and my screen was totally scratched and it also scratched the space above the click wheel and below the screen . i am a total scratch freak but still i was really mad . warning : if you do n't like your ipod scratched do not get this case ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ||| 0
very satisfied with my purchase . the item was a christmas present for my son and they got here in plenty of time and fit perfect . amazon was the only place i could find the shoes in stock and the price was also lower than any other site ||| 1
i bought this for a woman who is a small size eight , one of those people who is just a touch too big to wear a size six , and normal medium sized clothes usually run very loose . not this tiny shirt . it looked all right when she opened the package , but when she wore it , it made the kid look as if she had flub . it was inexpensive enough that i wo n't bother returning it , but the item , although well made , was sized so small as to be useles ||| 0
i love my birkenstock shoes . they fill great . i am a registered nurse . i am on my feet constantly all day . these shoes are great for the support my feet need . they are really comfortable . i will definately be purchasing more in the near future . ||| 1
so i ordered this shirt and i got an entirely diffent one , the packing slip had the right order # . the shirt i received was long sleeved , crew neck with a notch in it . ans when i called them , the person i spoke to was not the least bit shocked/ amazed or even willing to send the right one , she just said send it back ... think twice unless you do n't mind making trips to the post offic ||| 0

i am very pleased with the terry wrap that i bought as a christmas gift . i had looked in every store i was in while christmas shopping for one but found none so was very pleased to find this one . it is well made , looks good and the price was great . shipping was very quick without paying extra for express service ||| 1
okay , this cap is really stylish . but i think the sewing is n't quite finished . there were loose threads all over my caps when i got them . not to mention the parts that were n't even sewed ... no threads at all ||| 1
i bought this for christmas and i receive it with a large scratch rite on the hard screen where the screen is . i email back to see if they could do something and they never answer back . very rude ||| 0
i ended up giving away these shoes after wearing them one day . we have a recycle area in our apartment building , but it is usually used for things that are not brand new ! these shoes hurt my feet and had no cushioning at all against the concrete i walk on . i will not buy another pair of shoes on line again , unless i know the make and size from hands on purchase before ||| 0
i purchased these for my fiance to wear for our beach wedding in puerto rico . the quality is horrendous , the cut is for mc hammer not real men , and the company charged me over $ 22.00 to ship them to me and then told me i wanted them fed ex . not true , the pants were returned , the rest of my order cancelled and i will never purchase anything from this company again ||| 0
i realize this is n't an expensive bra , but i expected it to at least fit ! i 've never ordered a bra that was sized this crazy ! the band was way too big and the cups were way too small . needless to say i 'm returning it . save your money , ladies ! on top of that , it took almost a month to receive it because it was out of stock . even though figleaves displayed the item as in stock . this is the third time figleaves has done this for amazon items . i think i 'll skip buying from them in the future ||| 0
can you say p a i n ? this is what steve madden shoes are . pain . the soles must be made of cast iron . the upper materials must be made of the roughest of rope or some material meant to be deliberately scratchy and rough . i am convinced that this madden person hates women . if it were in my power , i would track down steve madden and force said person to wear their own shoe designs , only standing , walking and ... ..dancing even until they committed to making shoes that are fit for human beings to wear without any pain . ||| 0
not very good pictures or description.wallet was smaller than i expected.quality was ok , not competitively priced ||| 0

i got both my sons these socks and really liked the performance , thickness , etc . however , it has been only two months and several of my three year olds ' socks now have holes in the toes , the heels , and you can see the fabric wearing thin and about to have holes at other places . my 8 month olds ' socks are fine , however , he does n't give them the wear of a three year old . so if you have a baby , these socks are great ! if you have a preschooler , very poor choice ||| 0
